Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how your information is collected, used, and protected when you use this blog.

## Information We Collect

- **Newsletter Subscription:**  
  If you subscribe to the newsletter, we collect your email address for the sole purpose of sending you blog updates. Your email is never shared or sold to third parties.

- **Comments and Upvotes:**  
  To prevent spam and abuse, we use basic anti-abuse protections. We do **not** store your raw IP address. Instead, your IP is hashed with a secret salt before being saved to the database. This allows us to limit actions (such as one upvote per user/IP and comment rate-limiting) while protecting your privacy. The salt is never stored in the database.

- **Analytics:**  
  We do not use third-party analytics or tracking cookies.

## How We Use Your Information

- To send you newsletters if you subscribe.
